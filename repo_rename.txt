To change the name of a repository:

    1. Go to settings of your repository on GitHub.
    2. Rename your repository.

    # These two steps will rename your repository on GitHub but these changes will not be reflected on your local repostory automatically.

To reflect the changes locally:

    1. Rename your local repository folder.
        e.g. let your folder be C:\gh_one\
            let renamed folder be C:\git-commands\

    2. enter the repository folder.
        open the location C:\github-repo\ on your terminal/command prompt.

    3. check your remotes and branches using:
        git remote -v
        git branch

    4. rename your remotes:
        git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your_username/git-commands

    5. Confirm changes with:
        git remote -v
        git branch
